# Edwin’s dotfiles

While being heavily inspired on all example dotfiles configurations on GitHub, I decided to start my own to understand it better. However still much is based on [Mathias' dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). These files contain the basic setup for zsh based on oh-my-zsh with the great agnoster theme. 

## Installation

	git clone <repo>
	./bootstrap.sh

### Mac OSX
For OSX extra brew files are suppplied to setup an development environment quickly. It's advicesable at this point to make sure Xcode and Xcode developer tools are installed a priori the installation of the brew packages. Xcode can be easily installed from the App Store, the developers tools can be installed by running `xcode-select --install`. Afterwards brew install can be runned with:

	./bootstrap.sh --full-pull
